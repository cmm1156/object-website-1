-	I chose this object because it is my favorite pair of shoes. I have always been a fan of Spider-Man, and I first saw these in the movie Into the Spider-Verse. I looked online for a similar pair, and this I found this very inexpensive version.
-	Inexpensive, quality, vibrant, comfortable, Spider-Man
-	Seeing this object reminds of two places. First, my home because normally wear these indoors rather than outdoors, in order to keep them clean. Second, the movie theatre where I first saw the Into the Spider-Verse film.
-	My object looks somewhat similar to Nike Air Jordan 1. The shape is the same, but the attention to detail is virtually nonexistent. The lettering, perforations, and sole are very different, but this was never a concern for me because I enjoy them mainly for the high-top shape and color.
-	Running your hand across the outside, you will feel stiff, cheap faux-leather, and the inner fabric is also thin, cheap, and is sewn loosely, causing ridges in the fabric. The outside feels more premium than the inside, but the material holds up very well overall.
-	These shoes were purchased in a size larger than my actual shoe size (as per the suggestion of a previous customer). However, they are slightly larger than I would like, and therefore make louder than normal noise when walking.
-	There is a strong scent of faux-leather and chemicals.
-	I could see it moving clumsily like Miles Morales was in the beginning of the movie, before he became Spider-Man.
-	I purchased this item on Wish, a website that sells cheap and interesting items, usually originating from overseas companies. For reference, I paid approximately $25 for the knock-off of an item that is around $200.
-	These shoes are a representation of the type of things I enjoy.
-	For people who know about shoes, they see cheap, poor quality knock-off of a great design. I have had people who do not know about shoes compliment the color and design without knowing that they are blatantly fake. These types of people can see the same comfort and color palette that I see when I look at these shoes.
-	I wear them and walk in them.
-	This object is related to the Spider-Man universe and this is what I have always attributed it too.
-	I remember comparing my object to photos of the actual shoe. I noticed how very different the two actually were, but it did not bother me because they were inexpensive and still looked very good.
